Has it been done before? What can you learn from other companies? 
Everyone knows that most startups fail... So try your best to research the marketplace before you jump straight in :)

- Make a list of companies with existing products or solutions that offer similar solutions
- Learn about other products similar to the one you want to build. How do they market the product? What's their business model?
- Make a list of what makes your product or solution different from everything else on the market. Are you cheaper? Do you offer something new and exiting? Do you solve existing problems in a better or new way?
