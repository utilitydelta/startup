# Value

All startups must provide some sort of value to the customer. 
It can be something small, that is applicable to a wide audience (eg. sharing content on facebook). 
Or it can be something very valuable (eg. designing a fighter jet using CAD software) that is applicable to only a few specialist users.

Your business model is the way you profit from the value you create for others. 
The more value you create for your customers, the more money they are willing to pay for it.
