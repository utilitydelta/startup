# Personas

A persona describes an imaginary person. 

Good persona design should describe some background about each person - are they a trained professional engineer? A retired senior? A 5 year old child?

Next describe what are their goals. Do they want to share pictures with their family members? Do they want to take notes easily in a meeting at work? Describing goals allows us to design a solution that meets their requirements.

Personas give developers a better feel for who they are building the solution for. See more infomration at:
